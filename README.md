# Feature Extraction using Cross Correlation for EMG Signals
#
Abstract:\
Electromyography (EMG) is the electrical signal generated by skeletal muscles. EMG is widely 
used in the medical field for clinical diagnosis purposes. Two main neuromuscular disorders 
that can be classified by EMG signals are, Myopathy and Neuropathy. EMG signal-based
classification of several neuromuscular disorders have been reported in many available
literatures. Different techniques have been employed for extracting the features of EMG 
signals. This study will point out previous approaches that has been done for classifying the 
two neuromuscular disorders and will further include the methodology approached by our team 
for correctly classifying the signals accordingly.

## To Run
1: Run FeatExtractor.m to extract features from the dataset.\
2: Run HealthytrainClassifier.m to classify among the the diseased and healthy.\
3: Run DiseaseClassifierSVM.m to classify among the type of disease.
